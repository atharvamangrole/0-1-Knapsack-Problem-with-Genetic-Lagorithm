# 0-1-Knapsack-Problem-with-Genetic-Lagorithm
This repository explains, 0/1 Knapsack problem briefly and provides few Genetic Algorithms which are a way to solve it. This repository also consists of a paper (Titled NC GA FR.pdf) on those few algorithms and explains them thoroughly, this paper was submitted as part of the coursework for Natural Computing module for my third year of university.
Three codes are also present which are written in python with IDE as PyCharm.
